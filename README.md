# SDC_ObjPlacer

This script allows a specific job role to be able to place down objects for RP purposes. For example a police officer can place down a cone or barrier for a traffic stop! It comes with a nice 2D drawn hud in the top left which shows which object you are placing. This resource also allows the placing of objects with the location of your mouse.
